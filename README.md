Infrared (IR) small target detection is a critical task in IR search and track (IRST) applications such as precise guidance and early warning. However, due to the specific characteristics of IR images, detecting small targets can be a challenging task. Targets are usually a few pixels in size and lack distinguishing shapes or textures, and they are often immersed in complex backgrounds that include many pixel-sized noises with high brightness. In addition, real-time target detection is essential in modern military applications, making research on real-time detection algorithms of small targets highly urgent. There are two general categories of algorithms for small target detection: sequential detection methods and single-frame detection methods. Sequential detection methods work well when there is prior knowledge of the targets and assumptions of static backgrounds or consistent targets in adjacent frames. However, these assumptions are often not met in practical applications of IRST systems. Therefore, single-frame detection methods are crucial for practical applications. Single-frame detection methods that use filtering techniques include adaptive and morphological filtering.. To address the challenges of detecting small targets in complicated IR images, a novel local contrast measure (NLCM) method has been developed. The NLCM method consists of three phases: preprocessing, segmentation, and detection. In the preprocessing phase, the IR image is segmented into local regions using a sliding window. The obtained local regions are used to calculate the saliency map based on NLCM, and an adaptive threshold is used to extract the target region. The NLCM method is an effectiveand robust high-speed small target detection algorithm that can be applied to a wide range of IR images. By using a local contrast measure, the NLCM method is able to identify small targets that may be difficult to detect using traditional methods. Furthermore, the adaptive threshold used in the detection phase allows for a more accurate and precise extraction of the target region, reducing false positives and increasing the overall accuracy of the algorithm.
